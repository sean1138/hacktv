Project for a friend that wants to replicate the look and feel of the old WebTV browser in their website.

## Recreating the WebTV browsing experience
Since I can find video of it it's easier to watch to get an idea of how the WebTV browser worked than try to explain it.

There was no mouse or other pointer device on WebTV, it was all keyboard navigation.  Desktop browsers can navigate links via the tab key and it was decided that this functionality was good enough rather than using a script for navigating with the arrow keys exactly the way that it worked in the WebTV browser.

template.html is the example produced for the client to use and learn how to write modern html from and was intended to be the src of an iframe in a different html file.

template2.html includes the frame of the website and the content in one file.

There were no scrollbars in the WebTV browser, that's what the arrows at the bottom right are for, scroll indicators.  Since he uses firefox he doesn't care about other browsers and these arrows do not work in IE10.  IE11 was not tested but they probably don't work there either.

The animated green heartbeat graph next to the scroll indicator arrows was used to show when there was network activity (downloading) on WebTV.  In this project it's just a looping animation.
